## Hi, I'm Sophia!

**Agronomist and Quality Assurance Engineer**

I'm an agronomist with a passion for integrating data science, machine learning, and software development into agriculture to promote sustainable practices. I specialize in soil nutrient management, precision agronomy, and nutrient recommendation systems. I am currently in charge of the soil nutrient calibration trials for the Government of Prince Edward Island.<br/>

And when I am not working as an agronomist, I am dedicating my time to shaping and deeveloping [Rockae](https://rockae.com/). Although, my role says "Qaulity Assurance Engineer", I wear multiple hats working at [Rockae](https://rockae.com/). From front-end development and data analysis to project management, but my primary focus is on QA and product testing. So, while my title says QA Engineer, I actively contribute to building and improving the software ecosystem at [Rockae](https://rockae.com/).<br/>

-  Nutrient Recommendation Models: Currently in the process of validating the soil nutrient recommendations for PEI through various research trials happening across the province. All supervised by me!! <br/>
-  Data Analytics & Visualization: All data analysis from the nutrient calibration trials are handled my me.<br/>
-  Machine Learning Projects: My most recent project is on developing a method of predicting turbo jet engine failure using NASA's Jet Engine Dataset, all part of my practicum with [Sandian National Labs](https://www.sandia.gov/).<br/>
-  Rockae Projects: Currently building an educational web application that will help make learning easier! check out [Rockae](https://rockae.com/).<br/>


ðŸ”¥**Technical Skills:** <br/>
